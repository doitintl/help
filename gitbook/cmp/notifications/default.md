# Default Notifications

Users you invite are assigned default notifications tailored to their Cloud Management Platform IAM role. These notifications are designed to ensure users are informed about important events related to their job function. For example, users with 'Finance User' permission will have 'Cloud Cost Anomalies,' 'Payment Due/Overdue,' and  'New Invoices' notifications enabled by default.&#x20;

Similarly, users with the 'Power User' role get the 'Cloud Known Issues,' 'Cloud Quota Utilization,' 'Cloud Cost Anomalies', and 'Daily Digest notifications.&#x20;

Note that these default notifications would only be assigned to the new users you invite and won't affect existing users.
