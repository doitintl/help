# Slack Notifications

If you have a [shared Slack channel](../services/consulting-support/shared-slack-channel.md) with DoiT International, you can [configure notifications](../services/consulting-support/shared-slack-channel.md#configure-your-shared-slack-channel) for that channel.

From within the CMP, select the gear icon from the top navigation bar, then choose _Slack_ (under _Account settings_) from the drop-down menu. After choosing the _Slack_ menu item, the CMP will bring you to the _Slack_ settings page:

From here, you can [configure the channel notifications](../services/consulting-support/shared-slack-channel.md#configure-your-shared-slack-channel).
