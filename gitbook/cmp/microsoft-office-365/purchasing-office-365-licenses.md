# Purchasing Office 365 Licenses

If you manage your Office 365 licenses with DoiT International, you can easily purchase more. We increase your monthly payment to cover the new licenses.

Within the CMP, select _Billing_ from the top navigation bar and then select _Assets_. The CMP will take you to the _Assets_ page.

From the _Assets_ page, select _Office 365_ from the left-hand menu:

You can see the number of licenses in use next to each _Quantity_ label.

When you have located the subscription you would like to modify, you can add or remove as many licenses as you like, using the **-1** and **+1** buttons, respectively.

To apply your changes, select the _APPLY_ button in the bottom right-hand corner of the card.

If you are purchasing additional licenses, you will be prompted to approve the purchase before continuing:

If you remove licenses, charges will be deducted from your account as reflected in the next month's billing to your organization.

Please note that only FLEXIBLE plans allow you to decrease the number of licenses. For more information, please review the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/buy-licenses?view=o365-worldwide).
