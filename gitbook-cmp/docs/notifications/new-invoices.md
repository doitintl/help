# New Invoices Notifications

Customers can be notified when a new invoice has been created by enabling the alerts for 'New Invoices' in the profile section of the Cloud Management Platform. The email will include a link to the invoice which will allow online payments.

In order to enable or disable the notification itself, click your profile icon in the upper-right corner of the page header, then select **Profile.**

Select the '**Notifications**' tab and check the box for '**New Invoices**'. This change will automatically save.

Below is an example of the new invoice email notification we will send out.
