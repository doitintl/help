# Support access to GCP

DoiT International provides complete transparency and access control when accessing your _Google Cloud Platform_ (GCP) account.

When you open a technical support request with DoiT International, we may occasionally need to access your GCP account to help you most effectively. This document describes how to enable access and how access control works.

## Key points

* We only access your GCP account to provide technical support per our contractual obligations. We never access your GCP account for any other reason.
* Support engineers never have write-access to your GCP account. The only exception to this rule is that we are able to raise AWS support requests on your behalf.

## Grant access

When you request technical support and create a new service request with DoiT International, you will be prompted to grant DoiT International access to the relevant GCP project.

A typical access grant is implemented with a `gcloud` command (part of [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)). The access is always read-only, limited, and only provides access to the support engineers handling your request.

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding cassandra-db-prod-289507 \
--member="group:ticket-38432@cre.doit-intl.com" \
--role=roles/viewer --condition=None
```

For example, the above command:

* Grants read-only access (`--role=roles/viewer`)
* To a group of engineers assigned with request `#38432` ( `--member="group:ticket-38432@cre.doit-intl.com"`)
* For your Google Cloud project (`cassandra-db-prod-289507`)

We will automatically generate and display the appropriate command to copy and run when you create a support request.

## Revoke access

Support access is automatically revoked for security reasons when the ticket is resolved. The next time you create a support request, you will be prompted to provide our support engineers with access again.
