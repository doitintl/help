# External Services We Use

We rely on several 3rd party services which you may need to allow access to via your personal firewall. These are the mandatory services for Cloud Management Platform to function:

```text
https://*.googleapis.com
https://accounts.google.com
https://apis.google.com
https://fonts.gstatic.com
https://*.stripe.com
https://*.stripe.network
https://*.plaid.com
```

These services are optional and they help us to make Cloud Management Platform better:

https://*.announcekit.app
https://*.uservoice.com
https://*.fullstory.com
https://*.pingdom.net
```
