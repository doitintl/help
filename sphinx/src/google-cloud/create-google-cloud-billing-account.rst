Create Google Billing Account
=============================

.. epigraph::

   How to create a Google Cloud Billing Account directly from the Cloud Management Platform.

Overview
--------

The *Cloud Billing accounts* are used to define who pays for a given set of Google Cloud resources and *Google Maps Platform APIs*. Access control to a Cloud Billing account is established by IAM roles. A Cloud Billing account is connected to a DoiT International :doc:`billing profile <../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile>`.

Use these instructions to create a Google Cloud Billing Account and link it to your company's billing profile using the Cloud Management Platform.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Required Permissions: *Assets Manager*

.. ATTENTION::

   Please note: Your user account must be linked to at least one billing profile in the *Cloud Management Platform*.

Create a new Billing Account
----------------------------

Start with you logging into the `Cloud Management Platform <https://app.doit-intl.com>`__, and select *Manage Licenses & Assets* from the main dashboard:

.. WARNING::

   Your domain is added as a *Billing Account User* on the new Billing Accounts you create in the CMP. This allows anyone on the domain to link projects to the billing account.
