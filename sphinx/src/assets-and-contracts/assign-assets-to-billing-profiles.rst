Assign Assets to Billing Profiles
=================================

.. epigraph::

   Configure which assets appear on which Billing Profile invoices

You can assign assets to :doc:`Billing Profiles <../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile>` for invoicing purposes. Since every Billing Profile receives its own monthly invoice, how you assign assets will affect how each entity is billed.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Required Role**: Admin**

Access Assets from the menu on the left-hand side of the page and clicking on Assets.
