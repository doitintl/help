   Widgets are cards you can place on dashboards for additional functionality

Widgets are an essential aspect of the home dashboard in the Cloud Management Platform customization. You can change the location of the widgets by clicking the 'Customize' button and reordering the widgets on your dashboard, as well as remove them altogether if you wish.

**Manage Licenses & Assets** opens the assets page which you can use to purchase additional licenses and subscriptions for G Suite and Office 365.

**Access & Pay Invoices** provides a list of your company's invoices from DoiT International, including their amounts, payment status, and invoice details.

**Access Support** is used to create new customer service requests or access existing requests previously opened by you or someone on your team.

*Please note that if one of the items on that list is disabled (grayed out), it means your user doesn't have the appropriate credentials required to perform this action.*

Essential Contacts
------------------

There are several people involved in making sure your cloud assets are managed to the best possible extent and you're enjoying the best service. Usually, it's the group of your DoiT International and Google/Amazon/Microsoft account managers, depending on which cloud platforms your company uses.

Using this widget you can see who is your account manager at DoiT International as well as at Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. You can use this information to send an email to your Account Manager by clicking on their email address. When using a mobile device, click on the phone number and to dial.

Cloud Commitment
----------------

Analyze your Google Cloud or AWS attainment to your contractual commitments, including forecasts of your future expenses towards the commitment. Using this widget, you can track your actual spending, the remainder of the contract, and managing the rollover for the following period. Also, if you fall short of your commitment for a specific period, you can identify the shortfall.

The chip on the top right-hand corner of the widget displays the forecast of estimated spending for the current period.

The dark blue section of the bar displays the actual spend, and you will be able to see an even darker shade of blue if/when you have a rollover to the next period.

The light blue section of the bar displays the remaining commitment. The pink section of the bar displays the shortfall, i.e., your actual consumption is less than the commitment.
