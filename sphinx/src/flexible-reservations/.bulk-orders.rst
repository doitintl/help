   Managing your Flexible Reservations via bulk import

When you have a lot of Flex RI orders to place for the coming month, bulk uploading your orders may save you lots of time. From within the CMP, you can make as many orders as you want by uploading a CSV file.

Begin by navigating to the Flex RIs page, and click on the vertical ellipsis (``â‹®``) at the top-right of your screen.

The following fields are optional and don't need to be filled for your CSV file to be processed:

* Note
* Recurring

To ensure your CSV file is structured properly, we recommend downloading the template below and using it to format your orders.
