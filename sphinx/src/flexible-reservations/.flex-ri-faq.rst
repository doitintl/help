   Frequently asked questions about Flexible Reservations

Overview
--------

Flexible Reserved Instances let you commit to EC2 Reserved Instances in one-month intervals while still getting 80%+ of the AWS-listed Reserved Instance discount. With Flex RIs, you'll eliminate RI lock-in risk for your less predictable workloads.

In order to use Flexible Reservations, your AWS account/s should be consolidated with the DoiT International billing organization. DoiT International is a global `AWS Advanced Channel Reseller <https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E000001HPlIAIA1/>`__.

How much can I save every month?
--------------------------------

You can realize 80%+ of the discount granted by the applicable AWS Reserved Instance 1-year Full Upfront.

For example, AWS grants a 19.5% discount on reserved instances for instances from the m5 instance family in the us-west-1 region. A FlexRI for this machine/region combination will provide you with a 15.6% (19.5% * 0.8) discount but without the risk of committing to the entire year.

Can I use FlexRIs if I am using AWS RIs or Saving Plans?
--------------------------------------------------------

Flexible reservations are applied to on-demand usage. Usage covered by AWS reserved instances or Savings Plans is excluded from our recommendations and the order user interface.

Can I buy FlexRI for 3 months?
------------------------------

Yes. Flexible Reservation orders can be configured as "recurring" for any number of months. Recurring orders will be automatically recreated every month.

Can I send a report to the CFO with the actual realized savings?
----------------------------------------------------------------

We display actual savings on our FlexRI dashboard. Your CFO would have access to this dashboard and would be able to monitor the utilization as well as the actual savings yielded by the Flexible Reservations.

Do you send an expiration reminder before the end of the month?
---------------------------------------------------------------

About 5 days before the existing Flexible Reservation/s expires (unless there is a "recurring" setting enabled), we will send you an email with a summary of all expiring flexible reservations.

How the discount is calculated exactly?
---------------------------------------

The discount is calculated by applying 80% on the applicable AWS Reserved Instances 1-year Full-Upfront "Savings over On-Demand". You can access AWS RI Pricing `here <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/pricing/>`__.

Can you make recommendations on which FlexRI(s) I should buy?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. :doc:`Flex RI Recommendations <flex-ri-recommendations>` identifies your AWS EC2 instances that aren't covered by a billing discount mechanism (RIs, Savings Plans, etc.), and calculates the ideal number of Flex RIs recommended to optimize your spend. You can then purchase these Flex RIs from DoiT in just a few clicks.

How do Flex RI Recommendations work?
------------------------------------

FlexRIs Recommendations provides clients a list of machines to commit to for the proceeding month. In the background, DoiT monitors your historical EC2 usage and locates EC2 machines that are not covered by any discount regime (Savings Plans, AWS RIs etc) and that were not yet ordered for the following month. DoiT will run an algorithm to find the optimal coverage based on the instances' size, region, normalized units, account, operating system and family type.

Upon accepting a recommendation a new order will be created for the following month and the recommendation will be recalculated. Please notice that since some machines are eligible for size-flexibility, ordering a machine from the same family type can affect the recommendation on others. For example: ordering 1 x r5.2xlarge Linux in us-east-1 is equivalent to ordering 2 x  r5.xlarge. of the same type Upon making an order of an r5.2xlarge you may see that r5.xlarge may be eliminated from the recommendations since the first machine covers the exact same workload.

Can you find a way to provide a discount based on consumption?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Our team is working on a new FlexRI feature that  once available, will automatically implement recommendations, always optimizing for cost. Under this model, you won't need to think about which Flexible Reservations to purchase or to what hourly spend you're willing to commit.

Do you support any Operating System?
------------------------------------

Right now, we support Linux and Windows-based (including with Microsoft SQL Server) operating systems. RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SuSe Enterprise Linux (SLES) are not yet supported.

How FlexRIs are different from Reserved Instances or Saving Plans?
------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, while Flexible Reservations do not yield as much discount as AWS Reserved Instances, you're not at risk of underutilizing reservations for longer than 1-month periods.
