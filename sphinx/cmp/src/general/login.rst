   How to login and access Cloud Management Platform

Overview
--------

In order to access the Cloud Management Platform, you have to sign in with your Google, Microsoft, or email account. If your company uses Google G Suite (now Workspace) or Microsoft Office 365, we recommend signing in with your Google or Microsoft identity.

Otherwise, if you don't have a Google or Microsoft account and this is your first time signing in, please click the 'SIGN UP' button and fill in your email and a password of your choice. Once you verify your email account, you will be able to sign in with your email and the selected password.

Login using Microsoft Accounts
------------------------------

When using sign in with Microsoft for the first time, the organization admin must sign themselves in to CMP and grant admin consent for CMP to read user info (e-mail addresses, etc.) for their org. Eg shown below:

Login using Google Accounts
---------------------------

When using sign in with Google for the first time, admin consent should not be needed unless it is specifically configured that way by the organization.

Login using Email and Password
------------------------------
