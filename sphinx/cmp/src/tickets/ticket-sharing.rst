Enable Ticket Sharing
=====================

   Share tickets with your coworkers or other teams in your organization

Ticket sharing allows users to see all tickets, even if the ticket was opened by another user in the organization. This is useful if multiple people are opening support tickets and the organization would like to have visibility into all tickets.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Required Permissions: **Billing Profile Admin**

Start with navigating to the 'Support' page by selecting the icon on the left-hand side menu.
