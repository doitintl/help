**Known Issues** are defined as any faults or defects in Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure services that may be impacting the performance or availability of your applications.

Any known issues from these platforms are displayed on the Known Issues page, accessible via the left-hand navigation bar in the CMP.

In the event that one or more of your cloud services aren't functioning as they normally do, before opening a ticket with DoiT International we recommend you check the Known Issues page.

If one of the known issues displayed looks to be related to the service issues you're experiencing, then opening a ticket with us is not advised. It will likely have to be resolved by the engineers on whichever cloud platform the issue is arising from.
