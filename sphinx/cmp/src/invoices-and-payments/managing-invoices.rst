There are five possible statuses for invoices:

#. **Open** - shows the amount owed and due date of the payment.
#. **Canceled** - canceled removes the charge but remains listed in your Sales Invoices history for review if necessary.
#. **Paid** - the amount was delivered and approved.
#. **Partially Paid** - the total amount was not fully delivered and has yet to have been approved.
#. **Past Due** - invoice due date of payment has passed.

By clicking on an invoice number (e.g., **IN1940032243**) you can review additional details of the invoices such as detailed invoice lines. There is also the option to view the document as a PDF file.

If you would like to pay for an invoice now, go to the '**Pay Now**' button on the top right-hand part of your page.
