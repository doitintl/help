   Cloud Perks are special benefits available to you as DoiT International customer.

Perks are service-based benefits available to DoiT International customers at no extra cost, including workshops, training, cost optimization sessions, case studies, and co-produced webinars. They can easily be browsed and requested on-demand from within the CMP. Let's go over how that is done.

Additionally, you will receive an email confirming that your request has been received.

Once requested, a ticket will be automatically created in Zendesk and assigned to the DoiT International engineer(s) that will administer the Perk.

In the ticket, you and the engineers will arrange a suitable time for the workshop, training, or pro-serv to take place. Finally, any questions you have prior to the start date can be asked here.
