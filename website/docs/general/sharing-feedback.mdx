# Sharing feedback

When it comes to building a better Cloud Management Platform for you and all customers, your feedback plays a key role. It is one of the important pieces of input we consider when planning our roadmap, and gives us clear indications of where the needs are in the market.

Now you can share product feedback and feature requests with us directly from the CMP. Read on to see how.

## How to share ideas within the CMP

To share your feedback with us, click on the question mark icon in the top right-hand section of the main navigation and click 'Provide feedback'.&#x20;

Select the functional area that your idea relates to and complete the remaining fields, providing screenshots or images to give more context as needed.

Once finished, click 'Add idea' and your idea will be submitted to our Product Team.

## Upvoting existing ideas in the Feedback Hub

When you share feedback and/or feature requests with us, they get submitted to our [Feedback Hub](https://feedback.doit-intl.com). There, you see and upvote any ideas you like.

Let's go over how to navigate the Feedback Hub and upvote ideas.

From the home page, select a category whose ideas you'd like to take a look at. Alternatively, you can search for them directly in the search box.

After clicking on a category, you can search for ideas by their sub-categories on the left-hand side. Additionally, you can sort through them via categories such as "Hot", "Top Ideas", "New", or "Status".

If an idea has been added to the roadmap or development has begun, you will see a colored status icon similar to the yellow "Planned" rectangle in the screenshot below.

Upvote an idea that interests you by clicking on the "Vote" button next to the idea. Finally &mdash; if you aren't signed in already &mdash; enter your email or sign in with Google to submit your vote.

You will be notified if the status of the idea changes or ultimately gets released in the product it corresponds to.
