# Your profile

To view your profile, select your account name from the top navigation menu, then select your name at the top of the drop-down menu:

import Zoom from '@site/src/components/Zoom';

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

<Zoom>
  <Image

    img={require('../assets/cmp-profile-drop-down.png')}
  />
</Zoom>

The _Cloud Management Platform_ (CMP) will take you to your _Profile_ page:

<Zoom>
  <Image
    alt="A screenshot of the _Profile_ screen"
    img={require('../assets/cmp-profile.png')}
  />
</Zoom>

The _Profile_ page has a form that allows you to edit the following information:

- _First Name_ and _Last Name_ &mdash; Your display name in the CMP
- _Job Function_ &mdash; Account admins can use job function to help [manage your organization](../user-management/manage-organizations.mdx)
- _Phone Number_ &mdash; Your international dialing code and local number
- _Default Dashboard_ &mdash; The default [dashboard](../dashboards/customizing-dashboards.mdx) to display when you first log in

When you edit the value of any form field on this page, the CMP will automatically save your changes.

:::note

Admins or users with the [Users Manager](../user-management/user-permissions-explained.mdx#users-manager) permission can [edit any user profile](../user-management/creating-a-new-user.mdx#editing-user-profiles).

## Permissions

To view your [role](../user-management/manage-roles.mdx) and associated [permissions](../user-management/user-permissions-explained.mdx), select _Permissions_ from the left-hand sidebar. The CMP will take you to the _Permissions_ screen:

<Zoom>
  <Image
    alt="A screenshot of the _Permissions_ screen"
    img={require('../assets/cmp-profile-permissions.png')}
  />
</Zoom>

The _Permissions_ screen includes the following information:

- Your currently assigned role
- A list of your role entitlements (aka permissions)
- A list of your assigned [billing profiles](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.mdx)

:::note

Admins or users with the [Billing Profile Admin](../user-management/user-permissions-explained.mdx#billing-profile-admin) permission can manage assigned [billing profiles](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.mdx).

## Notification preferences

To edit your notification preferences, select _Notifications_ from the left-hand sidebar. The CMP will take you to the _Notifications_ screen:

<Zoom>
  <Image
    alt="A screenshot of the _Notifications_ screen"
    img={require('../assets/cmp-profile-notifications.png')}
  />
</Zoom>

On the _Notifications_ screen, you can opt-in or out of the following notification types:

- **New Invoices** &mdash; We'll notify you every time there is a new invoice or adjustment

- **Credits Utilization** &mdash; We'll let you know on 75% of your Google Cloud or AWS credits and then again when they are fully exhausted

- **Cloud Quota Utilization** &mdash; Be notified every time one of your Google Cloud or AWS service quotas utilization is over 50%

- **Cost Anomalies** &mdash; We'll alert you when your cloud costs don't align with the anticipated spending (configurable with _Threshold_ and _Delta_)

- **Payment Due/Overdue** - Get automated updates when invoices are due and overdue

  - We will send the first reminder seven days before an invoice is due
  - We will send the second reminder four days after the invoice's due date
  - We will send the third reminder 10 days after the invoice's due date

- **[Cloud Known Issues](../services/consulting-support/cloud-incidents.mdx)** &mdash; Be aware of the known infrastructure issues with Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services ahead of time

- **Daily Cost Digest** &mdash; Receive a daily digest of spend vs. same period of the previous month (configurable with _Daily cost digest attributions_)

  Use the _Daily cost digest attributions_ input to select which attributions you want to include in your daily digest.

  You will receive one email per selected attribution detailing:

  - Previous day's cost
  - Month to date cost (sum costs accrued in the current month)
  - Cost trend (current month cost to date vs. previous month costs for the same date)
  - Forecasted current month cost

  We will send you daily digest emails at 06:00 UTC.

### Default notifications

New users are assigned default notifications tailored to their assigned [role](../user-management/manage-roles.mdx). These notifications ensure that users are informed about important events related to their job function.

| Role            | Default notifications                                                                                                 |

## API key

You need an API key to use the [Cloud Management Platform API](https://developer.doit-intl.com/).

To manage your API key, select _API_ from the left-hand sidebar. The CMP will take you to the _API_ screen:

<Zoom>
  <Image
    alt="A screenshot of the _API_ screen"
    img={require('../assets/cmp-profile-api.png')}
  />
</Zoom>

To generate a new API key, select the _GENERATE KEY_ button.

After you generate your API key, copy and store it somewhere handy. We won't display your API key again after leaving the _API_ page.

:::tip

In the bottom right-hand corner of the _API Key_ text box, you can use the icons to copy your API key to your system clipboard or download your API key as a JSON file.

:::

To delete your API key, select the _DELETE KEY_ button.
