Select the _SIGN IN WITH GOOGLE_ button and follow your organization's _Single Sign-On_ (SSO) instructions to log in.

:::tip

If your organization uses Google Workspace, we recommend that your staff members use this log-in method.

By default, administrator permission isn't required to log in to the CMP for the first time on behalf of your organization (unless Google Workspace has been explicitly configured that way by an administrator).

#### Use an existing Microsoft Office 365 account

Select the _SIGN IN WITH MICROSOFT_ button and follow your organization's _Single Sign-On_ (SSO) instructions to log in.

:::tip

If your organization uses Microsoft Office 365, we recommend that your staff members use this log-in method.

However, to set up access, a Microsoft Office 365 administrator must first log and grant the CMP permission to read user information for your organization.

#### Use an email address and password

If you already have a CMP account, enter your email address and password to log in.

If you do not have a CMP account, you can create one by selecting _SIGN UP_ and following the instructions.

If your organization (as determined by your email address) is already using the CMP, you can sign up without [being invited](../user-management/creating-a-new-user.mdx#inviting-new-users).

:::tip

If you have forgotten your password, enter your email address, then select the _CONTINUE_ button. On the next screen, select _Forgot password?_ and follow the instructions to reset your password.
