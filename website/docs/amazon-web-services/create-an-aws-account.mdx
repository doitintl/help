# Create an AWS account

As a customer, you can create a new AWS account directly from the _Cloud Management Platform_ (CMP).

:::important

You must be assigned access to the specific _Billing Profile_ under which the domain is managed in order to create a new account.

:::

Within the CMP, select **Billing** from the top navigation bar and then select **Assets**. The CMP will take you to the **Assets** page.

From the **Assets** page, select **Amazon Web Services** from the left-hand menu:

  alt="A screenshot showing the Amazon Web Services assets page"
  frame="drop-shadow"
/>

From the Amazon Web Services assets page, select the **Create account** button in the upper-right corner. The CMP will open a dialog:

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-billing-assets-aws-create.png')}
  alt="A screenshot showing the Create account modal dialog"
  frame="drop-shadow"
/>

Then:

1. Choose the billing profile for the account.
2. Chose a name for the account.
3. Set the root email.
4. Optionally, clear the **Delete AWS Organization role** checkbox.

   :::hint

   When you create a new account in an organization, AWS automatically creates an IAM role named `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`.
   This role has full administrative permissions in the new account, and the organization can assume this role to access your account.

   Keep this checkbox selected if you wish to delete this role and prevent access from the organization's account.

   :::

When you are done, select **Create**.

The CMP will display a confirmation message:

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-aws-account-successful.png')}
  alt="Account created successfully! Check your email for further instructions"
/>

The CMP will send you an email with further instructions. For example:

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/email-aws-create-2.png')}
  alt="A screenshot of a _New Account_ email"
/>
