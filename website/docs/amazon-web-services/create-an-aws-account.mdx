# Create an AWS account

As a customer, you can create a new AWS account directly from the Cloud Management Platform.

:::note

You must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to create a new account.

:::

:::caution

You will see an **OrganizationAccountAccessRole** in the new AWS account. This role is created by AWS and links back to the parent account. When creating the account we will use this role to [create the CloudHealth IAM Role](https://help.doit-intl.com/amazon-web-services/set-up-cloudhealth). The CMP or DoiT International will not use this role afterwards and you will have to **manually remove this role from your account**

:::

Within the CMP, select _Billing_ from the top navigation bar and then select _Assets_. The CMP will take you to the _Assets_ page.

From the _Assets_ page, select _Amazon Web Services_ from the left-hand menu:

From the Amazon Web Services assets page, select the arrow next to the _Invite Account_ button, then select _Create Account_ from the drop-down menu that appears. Finally, select the button a second time (which should now read _Create Account_).

The CMP will open a modal dialog:

  alt="A screenshot showing the _Create Account__ modal dialog"
/>

Then:

1. Choose the billing profile for the account
2. Chose a name for the account
3. Set the _root email_

When you are done, select _Create_.

The CMP will display a confirmation message:

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-aws-account-successful.png')}
  alt="Account created successfully! Check your email for further instructions"
/>

The CMP will send you an email with further instructions. For example:

  img={require('../../assets/png/email-aws-create-2.png')}
  alt="A screenshot of a _New Account_ email"
/>
