## Ways to export Cloud Analytics reports

Here's an example report:

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-example-report.png')}
  alt="A screenshot showing and example report"
/>

- For PNG or PDF exports, click on the hamburger menu in the top-right corner of the report visualization (directly below the _Timezone_ dropdown at the top of the visualization) and select the format you want.

- To export to Google Sheets or CSV, select the _View As_ dropdown (along the top of the visualization) and select the "Sheets Export" or "CSV Export" options, respectively. (Both options appear at the very bottom of the menu.)

  - If this is your first time exporting a Cloud Report to Google Sheets, you will be asked to give CMP permission to create Google Drive files. Once you've selected your email account, select _Export_ to view your Cloud Report in Google Sheets.

  - If you select the CSV option, a large textbox will be opened with the full contents of the CSV file, ready to be copied.
