# Trend Analysis

Oftentimes when analyzing our cloud usage, we're overwhelmed with so many data points that it becomes impossible to identify important trends. _Trend Analysis_ helps you cut through the "noise" and isolate what is trending upward or downward in a single click.

Use forecasting in your Cloud Analytics reports by selecting the _Trending Up_ or _Trending Down_ options from the _ML Features_ drop-down menu on the left-hand side of the report:

Using the [Mann-Kendall](https://www.statisticshowto.com/mann-kendall-trend-test/) algorithm, the trending feature removes "noise" from your Cloud Analytics Reports and only shows trending [Metrics](editing-your-cloud-report.mdx#metrics) (i.e. Cost or Usage) in your series.

Here's what the same report looks like with the _Trending Up_ option selected:
