## Create a report from scratch

To create a new report from scratch:

1. Log in to the CMP, select **Analytics** from the top navigation bar, and then select **Reports**.

2. Select the **Explore** button in the upper-right corner of the Reports page, or select **New Report** from the dropdown list.

     alt="A screenshot showing the Explore and New report dropdown"
     frame="drop-shadow"
   />

   The difference between the two options is:

   - **Explore**: Changes made to reports are _not_ saved _unless_ you give the report a name.
   - **New report**: Changes made to reports care automatically saved, regardless of whether you give it a name.

3. Choose fields to build your cloud spend report.

   See [Dimensions, Group by, and Filters](report-dimensions-groupings-and-filters.mdx) for details about the options.

4. Select the **Run** button to generate the report.

## Build on an existing report

CMP allows you to build a custom report based on an existing one, either a preset report or a custom report created by others.

To begin with, you need to make a copy of the existing report.

### Duplicate from the main screen

If you are on the main Reports screen:

1. Locate the report of interest.

2. Select the three vertical dots menu (**&vellip;**) at the rightmost end of the report entry.

3. Select **Duplicate**.

     alt="A screenshot of the Duplicate option"
     frame="drop-shadow"
   />

### Clone/customize from the report page

While viewing a report, you can make a copy of it by selecting the _copy file_ icon from the right-hand menu.

<picture
  img={require('../../../assets/png/cmp-report-clone-button.png')}
  alt="A screenshot of the Duplicate option"
  frame="drop-shadow"
/>

- The _Clone_ function is available for custom reports, whether you created it or a colleague did.
- The _Customize_ function is available for [preset reports](index.mdx#preset-reports).

### Edit the copy

Once you chose to _Duplicate_, _Clone_, or _Customize_ a report, the copy will appear as a new report with a name beginning with _Copy of_ followed by the name of the original report.

You can then edit the report's name and make adjustments. Read more at [Edit reports](editing-your-cloud-report.mdx).
