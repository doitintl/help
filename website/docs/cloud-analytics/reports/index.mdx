# Reports

Cloud Analytics reports give you instant visibility into your Google Cloud or AWS costs without spending hours scanning through vendor's bills.

## FAQ

### When are the metric amounts (Cost, Usage, etc) for a day counted as "final"?

You can consider numbers "final" for 3 days after the date. With that in mind, there is really no SLA for this and numbers can change any time if there are corrections or delays that needs to be applied.

### Are the reports back-filled/updated, and at what frequency?

Cloud Analytics data is updated hourly.

### What timezone are Cloud Analytics reports based on?

Data from Google Cloud is based on Pacific time, while data from AWS is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

You can [configure a default timezone for new Cloud Analytics reports](../../general/general-settings.mdx).

Timezone used to aggregate the time interval in your report.

:::note

If you modify your timezone to reflect your local or company time, the totals will not reflect the invoices.
