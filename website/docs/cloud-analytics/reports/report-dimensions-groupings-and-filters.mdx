# Dimensions, Group by, and Filters

When creating a report, you can choose from a variety of billing dimensions, including custom, project, and system labels, to build a detailed view of your cloud spend. You can also further customize your reports by grouping or filtering using these dimensions.

## Overview

Below is the screen you'll see when [creating a new report from scratch](create-report.mdx#create-a-report-from-scratch):

You can select the following chips to build the report:

- **&#43; Add Dimension**: Add fields along the X-axis (horizontal) of the chart.

- **&#43; Add Grouping**: Add fields along the Y-axis (vertical) of the chart.

- **&#43; Add Filter**: Use [standard dimensions](#standard-dimensions), [labels](#labels), or tags as filters to view specific information. For example, if you only want to check entries related to one cloud provider, you can select this button, choose _Cloud_, and then specify the cloud provider of interest. See [Filtering dimension values](editing-your-cloud-report.mdx#filtering-dimension-values) for more information.

In the example screenshot below, projects are grouped along the Y-axis, and project data is displayed along the X-axis. The year, month and day have been added as **Dimensions** so the data/columns are displayed along the X-axis.

## Date/Time dimensions

When creating a new report, the **Year**, **Month**, and **Day** dimensions are added by default.

The Date/Time dimensions are connected with the display option **Time Interval**. Changing the time interval will affect the Date/Time dimensions accordingly. For example, selecting the Time Interval _Hour_ will result in _Hour_ being automatically added to the dimensions.

## Standard dimensions

- **Attribution**: Choose one or more existing [attributions](../attributing-cloud-spend.mdx) to build your report.

- **Billing Account**: This dimension refers to the _Billing Account_ in CMP &mdash; _Assets_ for Google Cloud; _Cloud health account ID_ and _Cloud Health name_ for AWS.

- **Cloud**: This reflects the cloud provider either _Google Cloud_ or _Amazon Web Services_ or both.

- **Cost Type**: The Cost Type dimension helps to identify the type of charge covered for a specific billing item. For example, with AWS this helps to distinguish between RI fees, usage fees, saving plan fees, and taxes (if applicable).

- **Country**, **Region**, **Zone**: These dimensions refer to the cloud location where resources are deployed. See [Google Cloud Locations &mdash; Regions & Zones](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/) and [AWS Regions and Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/).

- **Credit**: A credit is usually a cloud provider's way of implementing discounts such as committed use discounts, sustained use discounts, or free-tier usage of a service.

- **Folder**: Folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Google Cloud resources. folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis.

- **GCP Marketplace**: This dimension helps to distinguish between services from Google Cloud Marketplace and Google Cloud itself.

- **Global Resource**: A globally unique Google Cloud service identifier for the resource that generated relevant usage.

- **Operation**: A specific AWS operation that generated relevant usage. For example, a value of `RunInstances` indicates the operation of an Amazon EC2 instance.

- **Resource**: An identifier for the resource that generated relevant usage. Available for both AWS and Google Cloud.

- **SKU**: The ID of the resource used by the service. For the full list of SKUs, see the [Pricing table report](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/pricing-table).

- **Scope (Project/Account)**: This dimension refers to the AWS Account ID; whereas for Google Cloud this identifies the Project ID

- **Service**: A service is the high-level _type_ of cloud technology that can be broken down into SKUs. A SKU is the resource itself for which there's a given Price Per Unit.

- **Unit**: This dimension corresponds to the **Usage** Metric. It varies by service but generally refers to their unit of measure. For example, Core &mdash; _hour_; Ram &mdash; _gibibyte hour_; EC2 &mdash; _vCPU-Hours_.

## Labels

Labels are key-value pairs that are used for identifying, organizing, and grouping resources to help tracking cloud spend. They can be either user-defined or generated by the cloud provider or DoiT.

When creating reports in CMP, you will see label dimensions in different categories:

- **Labels**: In general refer to the cost allocation tags for AWS and labels for Google Cloud as assigned to resources.

- **Project Labels**: Specific to Google Cloud for labels set on the project level.

- **System Labels**: Label systematically generated by DoiT, AWS, or Google Cloud. Read more at [System labels](#system-labels).

:::attention

Not all [AWS cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) are automatically imported into CMP. If you need new tags for your reports, please submit a [support request](../../services/consulting-support/index.mdx).

:::

:::important

Google's GKE cost allocation feature will add the `goog-k8s-cluster-name`, `goog-k8s-namespace`, and `k8s-label/<label_key>` to the regular Labels section. For more information, refer to [Google Cloud Docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cost-allocations#view_breakdown).

:::

### System labels

System Labels are systematically generated by DoiT, AWS, or Google Cloud. Usually you can tell which label is created by whom from the prefix of the label. For example, labels generated by DoiT starts with `cmp`, while labels generated by Google starts with `compute.googleapis.com`.

:::hint

For the sake of simplicity, once you selected a system label generated by DoiT or Google, it will be replaced with a short name or alias. Note that due to the large amount of AMS labels, they are not assigned any alias and thus will stay the same whether selected or not.

:::

Below are the full lists of system labels generated by DoiT and Google Cloud.

#### By DoiT

- **cmp/eligible_for_commitment** (alias: `CUD Eligible`): Workloads eligible for [committed use discounts (CUDs)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds).

- **cmp/commitment_type** (alias: `CUD Type`): Commitment types. Examples: General purpose N1 commitments, Compute-optimized C2 commitments.

- **cmp/machine_type** (alias: `Machine Type`): Machine types. Examples: C2 Compute-optimized, E2 General-purpose.

- **cmp/memory_to_core_ratio** (alias: `GB/CPU`): The amount of memory (RAM) per CPU core.

- **cmp/compute_resource_name** (alias: `GCE Resource`): Google Compute Engine resource names. Examples: CPU, memory, extended memory

#### By Google Cloud

- **compute.googleapis.com/cores** (alias: `Cores`): The number of visible CPU cores.

- **compute.googleapis.com/memory** (alias: `Memory`): The amount of memory (GB).

- **compute.googleapis.com/machine_spec** (alias: `Machine Spec`): The machine types for your VMs.

- **compute.googleapis.com/is_unused_reservation** (alias: `Unused Reservation`): Unused reservations.

## GKE reports fields

If you have successfully configured [GKE Cost Analytics](https://help.doit-intl.com/cloud-analytics/gke-cost-analytics), additional sections named **Google Kubernetes Engine dimensions** and **GKE Labels** will be available for reporting on GKE spend.

### GKE labels

GKE labels are [labels for working with Kubernetes objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/). Only labels from Pod and PersistentVolumeClaim objects are tracked by usage reporting (see [Google Cloud Docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-usage-metering#limitations)).

:::attention

You cannot use both Google Cloud labels and GKE labels in the same report.

:::

### Google Kubernetes Engine dimensions

You can use the four GKE dimensions to understand the real costs of running Kubernetes-based workloads on Google Kubernetes Engine.

- **GKE Cluster**: A cluster is the foundation of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The Kubernetes objects that represent your containerized applications all run on top of a **cluster**.

- **GKE Namespace**: The Kubernetes namespace where the usage is generated.

- **GKE Region**: The Google Cloud region where the GKE nodes reside.

- **GKE Resource**: The GKE resource in use, for example, _CPU_, _memory_, and _storage_.

Below is a sample report snippet with a full breakdown of the four GKE dimensions:
