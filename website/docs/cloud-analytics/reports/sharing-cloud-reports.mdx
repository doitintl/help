# Share reports

You can share a report for others to view or edit, or transfer the ownership of your report to another colleague.

## Add access

To share a report, you need to give access to the intended recipients:

1. Open the sharing configurations window using one of the following methods:

   - If you are on the main Reports screen, select the three vertical dots menu (**&vellip;**) at the rightmost end of the report entry row, and then select **Share Permission**.

   - If you are viewing/editing your report, select the **Share report** button (three connected dots) from the right-hand menu.

2. Enter the email of the user with whom you intend to share the report, and give them _Viewer_ or _Editor_ access.

   />

3. Select **Add** to apply the changes. The recipient will receive an invitation email with the relevant information.

## Change permissions

After you've given others access to your report, you can change their permissions from the same configuration window, including:

- Change the permission of your whole team to _Viewer_ or _Editor_, or select _None_ to remove the access.

- Change the permission of an individual user to _Viewer_ or _Editor_, or select _Remove_ to remove the access.

- Transfer your ownership of the report to another user by selecting _Make owner_.

Make sure to select the **Add** button to apply the changes.

:::important

A report can have only one owner and the owner must be an individual user.

Once the ownership is transferred, the previous owner will become an _Editor_ of the report.
