# Metric filters

Metric Filters allow you to filter the data in your report at query time.

## Add a metric filter

You can add a metric filter using either one of the following methods:

- Select the **Metric filter** link below the **Metric** dropdown.
- Select the **&#43; Add Filter** chip.

Select the metric to filter, the operator, and the value.

:::tip

You can filter on a Metric different from the one used in the report. For example, you can chart **Usage** while filter any interval with a **Cost $lt; $50**

:::

The CMP supports the following operators:

- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equals (>=)
- Less than or equals (<=)
- Between
- Not Between
- Equals (=)
- Not equals (&#8800;)

When applied a filter chip will appear in the metric bar:

This chip will be _blue_ when applied to the currently shown metric, and _white_ while filtering a metric not currently shown:
