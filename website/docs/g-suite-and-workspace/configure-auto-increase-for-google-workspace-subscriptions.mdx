# Set Licenses to Auto-Increase

Auto-increase for Google Workspace ensures that you'll always have enough licenses available as your team scales.

All you have to do is set a threshold for the minimum number of Workspace licenses you'd always like to have available. Let's see how to set this up!

:::note

At a minimum, to manage Google Workspace licenses, your [User Role](../user-management/manage-roles.mdx) must contain the following permission:

- Assets Manager

You must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to configure auto-increase.

:::

Within the CMP, select _Billing_ from the top navigation bar and then select _Assets_. The CMP will take you to the _Assets_ page.

From the _Assets_ page, select _Google Workspace_ from the left-hand menu:

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

/>

Locate the subscription you'd like to configure auto-increase for, and click on the ellipsis icon on the right-hand side of the widget. Then choose 'Configure Auto Increase'.

/>

Configure the number of licenses you want to have available at all times. Once licenses get assigned to users in your organization, a new license(s) will be added automatically.

After you click "Save" you will see a success message in the lower-left corner of your screen, confirming your adjustment. Our system will check for and add, if necessary, additional licenses every 30 minutes.
