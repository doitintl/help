superQuery is a web-based IDE that helps data analysts & scientists work more productively when querying data stored in Google BigQuery, AWS Athena (S3), and AWS DynamoDB.

## What can I do with superQuery?

You can use superQuery to:

- **Leverage best-in-class query management**

  - Use [Query Tabs](superquery/superquery-editor/query-tabs.mdx) to work across many queries and easily switch between different results
  - Organize queries into folder-like [Boards](superquery/superquery-editor/organizing-queries.mdx)

- **Shorten pre-existing workflows**

  - Never worry about forgetting to save queries with Google Docs-like query auto-save.
  - Use variables to [make your queries dynamic](superquery/superquery-editor/variables.mdx) and save time when modifying them
  - Avoid having to save large results as a table with a much-larger 6,000,000 row export limit.
  - Looking for a particular query but forgot the name? Use [SQL Search](superquery/superquery-editor/sql-search.mdx) to quickly find it.
  - Immediately know how much your query is going to cost without doing the math yourself.

- **Generate one-click Charts and Dashboards**

  - Transform your query results into [Charts](superquery/superquery-editor/charts.mdx) that tell a story that tables can't.
  - Combine multiple query results into a [Dashboard](superquery/dashboards/create-dashboards.mdx) without having to export to a BI tool or Sheets.

- **Version-control your work**

  - Commit your queries to [GitHub](https://help.superquery.io/git-integrations/connect-github) and [GitLab](https://help.superquery.io/git-integrations/connect-gitlab)
  - View an unlimited version history for every query tab and BigQuery views

- **Collaborate on work with your team**
  - Share [individual queries](superquery/superquery-editor/query-tabs.mdx#share-tab) or [entire Boards](superquery/superquery-editor/organizing-queries.mdx#share-a-board) containing groups of queries and visualizations
