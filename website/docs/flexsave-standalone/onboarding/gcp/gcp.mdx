# Flexsave for GCP

Flexsave for GCP can dynamically maximize your cloud-compute discounts for [Google Compute Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP) with no risks or limitations of long-term use commitments.

In most cases, you'll be able to save the equivalent of a 1-year commitment discount on your cloud-compute spend with on-demand access to DoiT International's wholesale inventory of GCP [Committed Use Discounts](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds) (CUDs).

You can choose to get an estimate first, or start directly with Flexsave for GCP.
