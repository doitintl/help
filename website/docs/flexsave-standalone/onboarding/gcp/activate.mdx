## Confirm Flexsave Agreement

To proceed with Flexsave setup, make sure you read the DoiT International Flexsave Agreement, select the checkboxes, and confirm the agreement.

## Activate Flexsave for GCP

1. Enable discount sharing from the Google Cloud console, and select the checkbox to confirm.

   :::note

   By default, committed use discounts are applied on the project level. Flexsave attaches projects with CUDs to your Cloud Billing account. In order to share the discount with your own projects, you need to [turn on committed use discount sharing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts#turning_on_committed_use_discount_sharing).

   :::

1. Provide the location of your billing data, including:

   - **Organization ID**: See Google Cloud Docs on [Getting your organization ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id).
   - **Project ID containing your BQ billing data**: See [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects).
   - **Dataset ID containing your BQ billing data**: See [Getting dataset information](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-metadata#getting_dataset_information). Note that the dataset name is also referred to as the dataset ID.
   - **Table ID containing your BQ billing data**: See [Get table information](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables#get_table_information). Note that the table name is also referred to as the table ID.

   The code snippets will be updated automatically once the relevant information is provided.

1. Open the Google Cloud Shell, copy the command code snippets and run them in sequence in the shell.

   1. Grant DoiT service account BigQuery `Data Viewer` role on the dataset that contains your billing data.

      ```bash
      bq show --format=prettyjson $DATASET_ID | jq '.access = .access + [{"role": "READER", "userByEmail": "$DoiT_service_account_email"}]' > permissions.json

      bq update --source permissions.json $DATASET_ID
      ```

   1. Grant DoiT service account permission to attach projects with optimal CUDs to your Cloud Billing account.

      ```bash
      gcloud iam roles update doit_flexsave_role --organization=$ORG --title="DoiT Flexsave Role" --stage=GA --add-permissions=billing.accounts.get,bigquery.jobs.create,billing.resourceAssociations.create,resourcemanager.projects.createBillingAssignment
      ```

      - `billing.accounts.get`: Permission to fetch your billing account name.
      - `bigquery.jobs.create`: Permission to import customer billing tables.
      - `billing.resourceAssociations.create`, `resourcemanager.projects.createBillingAssignment`: Permission to link projects to your billing account.

1. Select **ACTIVATE FLEXSAVE**.

Once activated, Flexsave will start processing your information and building an optimization plan. The whole process may take up to 24 hours. You'll be notified by email when it's done.
