# Get your Flexsave estimate for GCP

You need a DoiT account to get the Flexsave estimate.

## Sign up

To get started with Flexsave:

1. Select the **Get your Flexsave estimate** button on the [DoiT homepage](https://www.doit.com/).

1. Create a DoiT account by following the instructions on the sign up page.

   You can use a Google account, a Microsoft account, or an email address and password to sign up for the estimate.

   1. Select the checkbox of **I agree to the terms of the policy agreement**.

   1. Select **Create Account**. You will receive an email with a link to verify the email address you provided.

   1. Once the email is verified, you'll be directed to the sign in page of [DoiT's Cloud Management Platform](https://app.doit-intl.com/login).

## Connect with GCP

After signing in, select _Google Cloud Platform_ (GCP) for your estimate.

Every Flexsave standalone account has a dedicated service account created by DoiT. To calculate your potential savings, you need to grant permissions to this service account at the organization level for it to fetch GCP recommendations.

1. Fill in your organization ID.

   See Google Cloud Docs on [Getting your organization ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id). The code snippet will be updated automatically with the organization ID.

1. Open the Google Cloud Shell.

1. Copy the command code snippet and run it in the cloud shell to create a custom role named `DoiT Flexsave Role` under your organization.

   ```bash
   gcloud iam roles create doit_flexsave_role --organization $ORGANIZATION_ID --title="DoiT Flexsave Role" --stage=GA --permissions=recommender.usageCommitmentRecommendations.list,compute.instances.list
   ```

   This custom role has the following permissions:

   - `recommender.usageCommitmentRecommendations.list`: Allows to view resource-based committed use discount (CUD) recommendations using Google's [CUD recommender](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds-recommender)
   - `compute.instances.list`: Allows to view compute instances (??? Why do we need this? Does this return compute instance under the customer's org?)

1. Run the second code snippet to add an IAM policy binding, which grants the `doit_flexsave_role` to the service account.

   ```
   gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding {your_organization_id} --member=serviceAccount:{DoiT service account email} --role=organizations/{your_organization_id}/roles/doit_flexsave_role
   ```

1. Select **VIEW MY ESTIMATE** to see the estimation result.

## Understand your estimate

The estimate is based on the following factors:

- Your last month's cloud bill
- The most commonly used resources and regions among DoiT customers
- An assumed annual growth rate of 0-5%
