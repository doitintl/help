# Get your estimate

You need a DoiT account to get the Flexsave estimate.

## Sign up for estimate

To get started with Flexsave:

1. Select the **Get your Flexsave estimate** button at [DoiT](https://app.doit-intl.com/signup/flexsave).

1. Follow the instructions on the sign up page to create a DoiT account.

   You can use a Google account, a Microsoft account, or an email address and password to sign up for the estimate.

   1. Select the **I agree to the terms of the policy agreement** checkbox.

   1. Select **Create Account**. You will receive an email with a link to verify the email address you provided.

   1. After verifying the email, you'll be directed to the sign in page of DoiT [Cloud Management Platform](https://app.doit-intl.com/login).

## Set up your estimate

Once signed in, select **Google Cloud Platform** for estimate.

To calculate your potential savings, you need to grant certain permissions to the DoiT Flexsave service account, as explained below.

1. Fill in your organization ID on the estimate page.

   See [Google Cloud Docs](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) for help finding your organization ID. The code snippets will be updated automatically once the organization ID is provided.

1. Open the Google Cloud Shell, copy the command code snippets and run them in sequence in the shell.

   1. Create a custom role named `DoiT Flexsave Role` in your organization.

      ```bash
      gcloud iam roles create doit_flexsave_role --organization $ORGANIZATION_ID --title="DoiT Flexsave Role" --stage=GA --permissions=recommender.usageCommitmentRecommendations.list,compute.instances.list
      ```

      The command above grants the custom role the following permissions:

      - `recommender.usageCommitmentRecommendations.list`: Allows to view resource-based committed use discount recommendations using Google's [CUD recommender](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds-recommender).
      - `compute.instances.list`: Allows to view compute instances.

   1. Add an IAM policy binding to associate the `doit_flexsave_role` role to the service account.

      ```bash
      gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding $ORG_ID --member=serviceAccount:$DoiT_service_account_email --role=organizations/$ORG_ID/roles/doit_flexsave_role
      ```

1. Select the **View my estimate** button to see the estimation result.

## Understand your estimate

- The most commonly used resources and regions among DoiT customers.
- An assumed annual growth rate of 0-5%.
