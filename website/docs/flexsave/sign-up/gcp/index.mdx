# Flexsave for GCP

Flexsave dynamically maximizes your cloud compute discounts with no risks or limitations of long-term use commitments.

Flexsave for GCP works by attaching projects with [committed use discounts](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds) (CUDs) to your GCP Cloud Billing account. In most cases, you'll be able to save the equivalent of a 1-year commitment discount on your cloud compute spend.
