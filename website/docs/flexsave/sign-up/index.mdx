If your company already pays for cloud access via DoiT, please refer to the instructions for [activating Flexsave](../index.mdx#start-saving) on your existing account.

## How does it work?

Flexsave analyzes your AWS or GCP workloads and assesses where commitment-based discount coverage could be improved. Then Flexsave automatically addresses that coverage gap, and continuously works to ensure that it remains minimized.

Flexsave gives you flexibility to adjust your cloud environment as needed, without worrying about huge bills or managing a complex commitment portfolio.

Activate Flexsave on your cloud instances to automate your compute savings &mdash; and get back to growing your business.
