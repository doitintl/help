# Sign up for Flexsave

Flexsave is your cloud co-pilot, dynamically maximizing your cloud-compute discounts for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) and [Google Compute Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP) without any of the risks or limitations of long-term use commitments.

Flexsave delivers [the equivalent savings of a 1-year commitment](../index.mdx#how-much-can-i-save) &mdash; _without the commitment!_ There's no reservation management needed, no costs to enable, and guaranteed savings on all covered workloads.

## How does it work?

Flexsave analyzes your AWS or GCP workloads and assesses where commitment-based discount coverage could be improved. Then Flexsave automatically addresses that coverage gap, and continuously works to ensure that it remains minimized.

Flexsave gives you flexibility to adjust your cloud environment as needed, without worrying about huge bills or managing a complex commitment portfolio.

Activate Flexsave on your cloud instances to automate your compute savings &mdash; and get back to growing your business.
