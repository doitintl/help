# Flexsave for AWS

Flexsave dynamically maximizes your cloud compute discounts with no risks or limitations of long-term use commitments.

Flexsave for AWS works by attaching AWS [Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/) (SPs) and AWS [EC2 Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/) (RIs) to your AWS account. In most cases, save [the equivalent of a 1-year commitment discount](../index.mdx#how-much-can-i-save) on your cloud-compute spend.
