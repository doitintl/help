## Create a DoiT account

You need to create a DoiT account before we can calculate your savings estimate.

Create your DoiT account by following these steps:

1. [Sign up for your estimate](https://app.doit-intl.com/signup/flexsave).

1. Follow the instructions on the sign up page to create a DoiT account.

   You can use a Google account, a Microsoft account, or an email address and password to sign up for the estimate.

   1. Select the **I agree to the terms of the policy agreement** checkbox

   1. Select **Create Account**

   1. If you used an email address to sign up, you will receive an email with a link to verify the email address you provided. After verifying the email, you'll be directed to the [log-in page](https://app.doit-intl.com/login).

      If you signed up using Google or Microsoft, you will be logged in immediately and you do not have to verify your email address.
