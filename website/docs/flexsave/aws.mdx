# Flexsave for AWS

Flexsave is your cloud co-pilot, dynamically maximizing your cloud-compute discounts for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) without any of the risks or limitations of long-term use commitments.

In most cases, save [the equivalent of a 1-year commitment discount](overview.mdx#how-much-can-i-save) on your cloud-compute spend with on-demand access to DoiT International's wholesale inventory of AWS [Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/) (SPs) and AWS [EC2 Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/) (RIs).

If you cannot find any [Convertible Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-reservation-models/standard-vs.-convertible-offering-classes.html) using one of our supported operating systems (see above) in your region, Flexsave does not support that instance type.

### FAQs

:::info

These frequently asked questions (FAQs) apply to Flexsave for AWS.

For platform-agnostic information, see:

- [Flexsave overview: FAQs](overview.mdx#faqs)

:::

#### What changes should I expect to see in my AWS Console?

For customers with a dedicated billing account, Flexsave will dynamically add or remove AWS accounts to your AWS Organization. These accounts carry the Saving Plans used by Flexsave. You should expect to see AWS accounts with 3-year Saving Plans and names like `fs-xxxxx` attached to your AWS organization.

#### Can I use Flexsave if I am already using SPs or RIs?

Yes, you can. Flexsave works exclusively with your on-demand compute usage and excludes anything already covered by your own SPs or RIs.

#### Can Flexsave provide discounts for on-demand capacity reservations?

Flexsave only supports AWS regional reserved instances. Because AWS on-demand capacity reservations require zonal reserved instances, Flexsave does not provide capacity reservation discounts or discounts for [on-demand capacity reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html).

:::

#### I have a special pricing plan on my AWS account. Can I still use Flexsave, and will it impact my existing savings?

Flexsave can still work with your account and will provide savings _in addition to_ the discounts from your pricing plan.

#### How soon after enabling Flexsave should I expect to see the savings?

Customers on a dedicated billing account should expect to see savings within 72 hours.

Customers on a shared billing account should expect to see savings in the first week of the subsequent month. Your savings are delayed because we need to wait for AWS to release your billing data at the end of the month. We need your most recent billing data to analyze resource utilization and determine the optimal savings strategy.

#### Why isn't my Savings showing up?

Savings for a new month will show up with a three-day delay (i.e., the 4th day of a new month).

#### How long does an instance have to run before it qualifies for Flexsave?

For customers with shared billing accounts, Flexsave allocates capacity for the current month based on utilization during the last 7 days of the previous month.

For customers with dedicated billing accounts, qualification is instantaneous as long as it falls under covered spend.

#### What is the Flexsave Management Costs line item on my invoice?

The _Flexsave Management Costs_ line-item covers the costs of using the AWS Cost Explorer APIs to query your utilization data.

We expect your _Flexsave Management Costs_ to be trivial, with limited variability month-to-month.
