# Copy and save queries to a different Board

To copy one or more query tabs to another [Board](organizing-queries.mdx), click on the **&vellip;** "More Options" button at the top-right corner of your screen, and click "**Save To**".

Next, select the query or queries you'd like to copy.

By default, your active query tab will be selected, but you can select multiple queries from your current Board to copy and move over.
