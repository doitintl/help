# Creating Dashboards

In another article we discussed how to [visualize a single query's result](../superquery-editor/charts.mdx) with the Chart tab.

However, there are cases where you'll want to explore more than one query at the same time.

For that, there is **Visualize**. This takes the latest result for each query tab you have in the current board and visualizes them all into one dashboard.

To do so, click on the "Visualize" toggle at the top-right corner of your screen

Each box represents a query tab's results. We refer to these as "widgets" in a dashboard.

In the example below, we have seven query tabs, so we see seven widgets in the dashboard.
