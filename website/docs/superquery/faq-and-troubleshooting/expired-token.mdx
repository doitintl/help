# How to deal with an expired / revoked token

## Why did I receive this error?

If you see an error message that says "**Token has been expired or revoked.**", this could be for a variety of reasons:

- You have recently reset / recovered your Google password.
- You or an admin on your team has actively revoked access to superQuery from the [Apps Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1) page.

It's worth mentioning that superQuery fully relies on BigQuery's authentication process, therefore we have no control over your user token. Therefore we use the token as it is.

Let's explore both cases mentioned above.

### You have recently reset / recovered your Google password

In this first case, the good news is that if you simply re-authenticate with superQuery, you'll get a new token from Google and can continue using superQuery uninterrupted.

To re-authenticate, just log out of superQuery and then log back in.

### Your token has been actively revoked

If you don't have the ability to grant superQuery access and get a new token, then speak with your IT administrator, or the person responsible for assigning permissions to your Google Cloud.

If the reason for the token revocation has something to do with questions around superQuery, our IT and Security team be more than happy to speak with your team.
