# Change Company Name

A customer can edit the name of their company if they choose to do so.

:::note

Required Permissions: **Billing Profile Admin**

You must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to purchase a license.

:::

From the main CMP dashboard, select the edit icon next to the billing profile you would like to update.

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

<Image
  alt="A screenshot of the CMP dashboard"
  img={require('../../static/img/docs/cmp-dashboard.png')}
/>

This will take you to the billing profile page:

<Image
  alt="A screenshot of the _Billing Address_ screen"
  img={require('../../static/img/docs/cmp-billing-address-screen.png')}
/>

After making changes on this screen, select the _SAVE_ button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. You should see the any change to your company name reflected immediately in the CMP user interface.
