# Changing your company name

A customer can edit the name of their company if they choose to do so.

:::note

Required Permissions: **Billing Profile Admin**

You must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to purchase a license.

From the main CMP dashboard, select the edit icon next to the billing profile you would like to update.

This will take you to the billing profile page:

/>

After making changes on this screen, select the _SAVE_ button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. You should see the any change to your company name reflected immediately in the CMP user interface.
