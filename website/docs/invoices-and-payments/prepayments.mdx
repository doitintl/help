# Paying in advance

If you would like to pay in advance, please [contact our support team](https://app.doit-intl.com/support), who will be happy to set up account credit and a prepayments process for you.

## Prepayment process

Because different organizations use different accounting methods, we are happy to tailor the prepayment process to suit your needs.

Here's an example of a typical prepayments process:

1. You create a _Purchase Order_ (PO) for the amount you want to prepay.

2. You send the PO to us.

3. We send you an invoice for the PO.

4. You pay the invoice using your [preferred payment method](updating-your-payment-method.mdx), then contact us to confirm the payment.

5. We confirm payment receipt and credit the funds to your account.

:::important

Please communicate with us via our [support system](../services/consulting-support/index.mdx#create-a-new-request) (e.g., when sending a PO) so that our whole team is available to assist you and keep track of the conversation. Our support team will route your requests to our finance team when necessary.

After receiving your first PO, we may need to request changes for accounting purposes. We will discuss the details with you while setting you up.

## Viewing invoices

The _Cloud Management Platform_ (CMP) allows you to view (and [download](downloading-your-invoice-reconciliation-file.mdx)) all of your invoices. Navigate to **Billing**, then select **Invoices**.

You should see something like this:

  alt="A screenshot of the Invoices screen"
  frame="drop-shadow"
/>

## Viewing account credits

The CMP dashboard has a [credits widget](../dashboards/widgets-overview.mdx#credits) that allows you to view your account credits.

:::hint

If your dashboard doesn't have the credits widget, you can use the **Add widget** button to [add it to your dashboard](../dashboards/customizing-dashboards.mdx#add-widgets).

With the credits widget added, you should see something like this:

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-dashboard-credits.png')}
  alt="A screenshot of the Invoices screen"
  frame="drop-shadow"
/>
