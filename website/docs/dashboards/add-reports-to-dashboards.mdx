# Adding reports to a dashboard

CMP Dashboards help you visually track and analyze key cloud data points and metrics. Adding [Cloud Analytics reports](../cloud-analytics/create-cloud-report/index.mdx) to [customizable dashboards](customizing-dashboards.mdx) gives you an at-a-glance view of your most important cloud infrastructure data points.

Required Permissions: **Cloud Analytics** (part of `Standard User` preset role)

## Add a report

To add a report to one or more dashboards:

1. Select the _Add to dashboard_ icon from the right-hand menu on the report page.

   <picture
     img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-report-add-to-dashboard.png')}
     alt="A screenshot highlighting the location of the _Add to dashboard_ icon"
     frame="drop-shadow"
   />

2. Select the target dashboard(s) for the report.

   - If you own the report or have its _Editor_ permission, you can use the **Show in widget library** toggle button to show or hide the report in the [Widget Library](widgets-overview.mdx).

     :::note

     Reports visible in the widget library can be added to dashboards using the **[Add widget](customizing-dashboards.mdx#add-widgets)** button on the dashboard navigation bar.

     :::

   - You can also select the **New dashboard** button to create a new dashboard for the report.

     alt="A screenshot showing the list of available dashboards"
     frame="drop-shadow"
   />

3. Navigate to the dashboard to view the report you just added.

From there, you can freely [customize](customizing-dashboards.mdx) the size and arrangement of the widgets as you see fit.

## Refresh report data

By default, report widgets on the dashboards are updated every 12 hours.

To check when a report widget was last updated, select the three dots menu (**&#8942**) in the upper-right corner of the widget.

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-widget-last-updated-info.png')}
  alt="A screenshot highlighting the last updated information of a report widget"
  frame="drop-shadow"
/>

You can use the **Refresh** option to fetch the latest billing data.

:::note

The information shown in the **Refresh** section is when CMP retrieves the billing data from the cloud service providers.

The freshness of the data itself is decided by the relevant cloud service provider. For example, GCP data depends on Google Cloud's [frequency of data loads](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery-tables#data-loads).

:::

## Open full report

To open the report that generates the visualization of the widget, select the three dots menu (**&#8942**) in the upper-right corner of the widget, and then select **Open full report**.

You can also select the report's name directly to open it.
