# Customizing dashboards

To personalize the appearance of a dashboard, you can reorder the widgets to your preference or remove them from the dashboard entirely.

If you have permission to edit a dashboard, the _Add Widget_ and _Customize_ buttons will be visible on the dashboard navigation bar:

  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-dashboard.png')}
  alt="A screenshot the default CMP dashboard"
/>

:::note

You can only customize a dashboard if you have the permissions to edit it. For example, if someone else in your organization has shared a public dashboard but has disabled edits, the _Add Widget_ and _Customize_ buttons will not be available.

## Add widgets

Selecting _Add Widget_ will slide open the widgets panel:

  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-dashboard-add-widgets.png')}
  alt="A screenshot showing the location the widgets panel"
/>

Select the plus icon next to the widget you want to add to your dashboard.

## Edit widgets

To edit widgets, select _Customize_ from the right-hand side of the dashboard navigation bar.

After selecting _Customize_, two icons will appear in the top right-hand corner of each widget. The first icon (two columns of three dots) allows you to drag widgets around and rearrange the dashboard. The second icon (a trash can) allows you to remove the widget from the dashboard.

When you are finished editing the dashboard, select _Done_ from the right-hand side of the dashboard navigation bar to save your changes.
