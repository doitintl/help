# Create a Google Cloud billing account

## Overview

The _Cloud Billing accounts_ are used to define who pays for a given set of Google Cloud resources and _Google Maps Platform APIs_. Access control to a Cloud Billing account is established by IAM roles. A Cloud Billing account is connected to a DoiT International [billing profile](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.mdx).

Use these instructions to create a Google Cloud Billing Account and link it to your company's billing profile using the Cloud Management Platform.

:::note

Required Permissions: _Assets Manager_

Your user account must be linked to at least one billing profile in the _Cloud Management Platform_.

:::

## Create a new billing account

Within the CMP, select _Billing_ from the top navigation bar and then select _Assets_. The CMP will take you to the _Assets_ page.

From the _Assets_ page, select _Google Cloud_ from the left-hand navigation to access the Google Cloud assets page:

From the Google Cloud assets page, select the _New Billing Account_ button.

The CMP will open a modal dialog:

<picture
  img={require('../../assets/png/cmp-assets-google-cloud-new-billing-account.png')}
  alt="A screenshot showing the _New Billing Account_ modal dialog"
/>

Enter your Google _Billing Account Name_, _Billing Profile_, and the email addresses of designated _Billing Account Administrators_.

When you are done, select _Create_.

The new billing account will now be listed on the Google Cloud assets page.

:::info

Your domain is added as a _Billing Account User_ on the new Billing Accounts you create in the CMP. This allows anyone on the domain to link projects to the billing account.

3. When prompted, provide one or more emails to invite new administrators.

To remove a billing account administrator:

1. Expand the list of billing account administrators.

2. Find the email address of the administrator you want to remove.

3. Select the trash can icon located to the right of the email address.
