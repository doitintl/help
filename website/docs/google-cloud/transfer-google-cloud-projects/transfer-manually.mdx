## Troubleshooting

### I can't change billing for the projects listed

To change billing account for a project you need to have proper permissions on the project itself. Usually having Billing Account Administrator on your whole Google Cloud Organization or the project in question is enough.

### While trying to select a new Billing Account no DoiT billing accounts appear on the list

Make sure you have access to the target Billing Account. To verify, please go to hello.doit-intl.com and check if your name is on the list:

If it's not, please contact one of the persons who are on the list to add you.
