# Transfer Google Cloud projects manually

You can transfer your Google Cloud projects manually by using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI.

:::note

Make sure you have read all the sections at [Before you start](index.mdx).

:::

:::note

To follow this tutorial, your Google Cloud account must have the following permissions:

- [Project Owner](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)
- [Billing Account Administrator](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)

Get in touch with your organization's Google Cloud administrator if you need help with permissions.

:::

## Use the Google Cloud console

1. Sign in to the [Manage billing accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) page in the Google Cloud console.

2. Select your organization, and then select your billing account from the list.

4. Change the billing account for all the linked Google Cloud projects. You need to perform the following tasks for each project.

   1. Select the three dots menu and then select **Change billing**.

      />

   2. In the popup window, select the new billing account provided by DoiT International.

## Use the Google Cloud CLI

:::important

To transfer a Google Cloud project to a DoiT billing account using the `gcloud` tool, you must be the owner of the project and have a billing role (or higher) on the desired billing account.

:::

### Link one project

The [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) (i.e., `gcloud`) has a [beta](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud#release_levels) [`billing project link`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/billing/projects/link) command, which you can use to link a project to a billing account.

For example:

```shell
gcloud beta \
    billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
```

Here, replace `PROJECT_ID` with the Google Cloud project ID and replace `0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X` with the billing account ID provided by DoiT.

### Link multiple projects

It's also possible to link multiple projects to a billing account using a [shell pipeline](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)>) that executes many `gcloud` commands in sequence, one for each Google Cloud project.

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

#### Dry run

Run the pipeline command below to print one complete `gcloud` command for every project you have access to (i.e., have at least _one_ permission).

```shell
gcloud projects list --format="value(project_id)" |
# highlight-next-line
    xargs -I {} echo \
        gcloud beta \
            billing projects link {} --billing-account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
```

Like before, replace `0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X` with the billing account ID provided by DoiT.

:::hint

The highlighted line shows the `echo` command used to print the `gcloud` command to the console instead of executing it (i.e., a dry run). A dry run allows you to verify that everything looks correct before you proceed with execution.

:::

Here's what the rest of the pipeline does:

<dl>
  <dt>
    <code>gcloud projects list --format="value(project_id)"</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Gets a list of every project you have access to and{' '}
      <Link to="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference#--format">
        formats the result
      </Link>{' '}
      to print the project ID to{' '}
      <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">
        STDOUT
      </Link>
      , which is then passed to <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs">
        <code>xargs</code>
      </Link> through the pipe (<code>|</code>) operator.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <code>xargs -I {'{}'}</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Reads the list of Project IDs from{' '}
      <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">STDIN</Link>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for each Project ID, <code>xargs</code> runs the{' '}
      <code>echo</code> command (and everything that follows), substituting{' '}
      <code>{'{}'}</code> for the Project ID.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

#### Execution

Remove the `echo` from the pipeline above to execute the `gcloud` command for every project you have access to:

```shell
gcloud projects list --format="value(project_id)" |
# highlight-next-line
    xargs -I {} \
        gcloud beta \
            billing projects link {} --billing-account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
```

:::attention

Running this command will link all your Google Cloud projects to the specified billing account ID provided by DoiT.

:::

## Verify the transfer

Once you completed the transfer, the transferred projects will appear in DoiT [Cloud Management Platform](https://app.doit-intl.com) within an hour.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't change the billing account for the projects

To change billing account for a project, you need to have proper permissions on the project itself. Usually having Billing Account Administrator on your whole Google Cloud Organization or the project in question is enough.

### While trying to select a new Billing Account, no DoiT billing accounts appear on the list

Make sure that you have access to the target Billing Account.

To verify, log in to the CMP and check if your email address is on the list of Billing Admins:
