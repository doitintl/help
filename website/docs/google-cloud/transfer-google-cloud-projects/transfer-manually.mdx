# Transfer Google Cloud projects manually

You can transfer your Google Cloud projects manually by using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI.

:::note

Make sure you have read all the sections at [Before you start](index.mdx).

:::

:::note

To follow this tutorial, your Google Cloud account must have the following permissions:

- [Project Owner](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)
- [Billing Account Administrator](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)

Get in touch with your organization's Google Cloud administrator if you need help with permissions.

:::

## Use the Google Cloud console

1. Sign in to the [Manage billing accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) page in the Google Cloud console.

2. Select your organization, and then select your billing account from the list.

4. Change the billing account for all the linked Google Cloud projects. You need to perform the following tasks for each project.

   1. Select the three dots menu and then select **Change billing**.

        frame="drop-shadow"
      />

   2. In the popup window, select the new billing account provided by DoiT International.

## Use the `gcloud` tool

### Link one project

The `gcloud` CLI tool has a (beta) [billing project link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/billing/projects/link) command, which you can use to link a project to a billing account.

For example:

```shell
gcloud beta \
    billing projects link MY_PROJECT_ID --billing-account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
```

Here, replace `MY_PROJECT_ID` with the Google Cloud project ID and replace `0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X` with the billing account ID provided by DoiT

### Link multiple projects

It's also possible to link multiple projects to a billing account using one `gcloud` command.

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

1. Run the command below to perform a dry-run of the `gcloud beta billing project link` command for every Google Cloud project you have access to (i.e., have at least _one_ permission).

   ```shell
   gcloud projects list --format="value(project_id)" |
   # highlight-next-line
       xargs -I {} echo \
           gcloud beta \
               billing projects link {} --billing-account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
   ```

   Like before, replace `0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X` with the billing account ID provided by DoiT.

   Notice the highlighted line showing the `echo` command is used to print the `gcloud` command that _would_ be run instead of running it (i.e., performs a dry run).

   Here's what the rest of the command does:

   <dl>
     <dt>
       <code>--format="value(project_id)"</code>
     </dt>
     <dd>
       <Link to="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference#--format">
         Formats the result
       </Link>{' '}
       to return the project ID.
     </dd>
     <dt>
       <code>|</code>
     </dt>
     <dd>
       Pipes the result of the left side of the pipe (<code>|</code>) into
       the right side of the pipe.
     </dd>
     <dt>
       <code>xargs</code>
     </dt>
     <dd>Builds and executes command lines from standard input.</dd>
     <dt>
       <code>-I {'{}'}</code>
     </dt>
     <dd>
       Replaces occurrences of <code>{'{}'}</code> in the initial arguments
       with names read from standard input.
     </dd>
   </dl>

2. Run the same command without the `echo` to actually run the `gcloud beta billing project link` command for every project you have access to:

   ```shell
   gcloud projects list --format="value(project_id)" |
   # highlight-next-line
       xargs -I {} \
           gcloud beta \
               billing projects link {} --billing-account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
   ```

   :::attention

   Running this command will link all your Google Cloud projects to the specified billing account ID provided by DoiT.

   :::

   :::note

   You can only link projects if you have the Owner permission.

   :::

## Verify the transfer

Once you completed the transfer, the transferred projects will appear in DoiT [Cloud Management Platform](https://app.doit-intl.com) within an hour.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't change the billing account for the projects

To change billing account for a project, you need to have proper permissions on the project itself. Usually having Billing Account Administrator on your whole Google Cloud Organization or the project in question is enough.

### While trying to select a new Billing Account, no DoiT billing accounts appear on the list

Make sure that you have access to the target Billing Account.

To verify, log in to the CMP and check if your email address is on the list of Billing Admins:
