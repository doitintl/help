To request the perk for your team, select the _REQUEST PERK_ button in the top right-hand corner.

After selecting _REQUEST PERK_, the CMP will display a status message and email you to confirm your request.

All perk requests result in a [support ticket](consulting-support/index.mdx), and we will contact you with more information. Please feel free to use the support ticket to ask any questions you may have.
