## Essential Contacts

There are several people involved in making sure your cloud assets are managed to the best possible extent and you're enjoying the best service. Usually, it's the group of your DoiT International and Google/Amazon/Microsoft account managers, depending on which cloud platforms your company uses.

## Cloud Commitment

Analyze your Google Cloud or AWS attainment to your contractual commitments, including forecasts of your future expenses towards the commitment. Using this widget, you can track your actual spending, the remainder of the contract, and managing the rollover for the following period. Also, if you fall short of your commitment for a specific period, you can identify the shortfall.

The chip on the top right-hand corner of the widget displays the forecast of estimated spending for the current period.

The dark blue section of the bar displays the actual spend, and you will be able to see an even darker shade of blue if/when you have a rollover to the next period.

The light blue section of the bar displays the remaining commitment. The pink section of the bar displays the shortfall, i.e., your actual consumption is less than the commitment.
