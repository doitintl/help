# Flexsave for GCP

Flexsave is your cloud co-pilot, dynamically maximizing your cloud-compute discounts for [Google Compute Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP) without any of the risks or limitations of long-term use commitments.

In most cases, save [the equivalent of a 1-year commitment discount](overview.mdx#how-much-can-i-save) on your cloud-compute spend with on-demand access to DoiT International's wholesale inventory of GCP [Committed Use Discounts](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds) (CUDs).

## Capabilities

### Supported regions and machine types

Flexsave supports all GCP [regions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones) and [machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) supported by resource-based CUDs (except for GPU accelerators, i.e., `A2` instances). We don't support [commitments for GPUs or SSDs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts#commitments_for_gpus_and_local_ssd).

### FAQs

:::info

These frequently asked questions (FAQs) apply to Flexsave for GCP.

For platform-agnostic information, see:

- [Flexsave overview: FAQs](overview.mdx#faqs)

:::

#### What changes should I expect to see in my Google Cloud Console?

You should expect to see:

- Commitment scope set to _Billing account_
- Projects with 3-year committed use discounts and names like `doitintl-fs-xxxxxxx` attached to your billing account

The commitments will apply committed use discounts across all eligible usage (all projects) associated with this billing account when enabling the billing account scope.

#### How soon after enabling Flexsave should I expect to see the savings?

You should expect to see savings within 72 hours.

**Why isn't the Savings showing up?**

The Savings show with a three-day delay. At the beginning of a new month, the Savings will show on the 4th day of the month.&#x20;

#### Can I use Flexsave if I already use CUDs or _Sustained Use Discounts_ (SUDs)?

Absolutely. Flexsave works exclusively with your on-demand compute usage and excludes anything already covered by an existing discount.

Any resources that do not qualify for committed use discounts automatically qualify for sustained use discounts. You can't combine committed use discounts and sustained use discounts for the same resources.

#### Can I use Flexsave with _Google Kubernetes Engine_ (GKE)?

Flexsave can provide CUD discounts for GKE nodes that use the [Google Compute Engine (GCE) pricing model](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts#restrictions). However, we cannot provide [CUD discounts for GKE Autopilot Mode](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/cud).

#### I have a special pricing plan on my GCP account. Can I still use Flexsave, and will it impact my existing savings?

Flexsave can still work with your account and will provide savings _in addition to_ the discounts from your pricing plan.
