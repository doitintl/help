## View tickets

From within the CMP, select _Services_ from the top navigation bar, then select _Consulting and support_:

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

/>

By default, the _Consulting and support_ page lists all of your current request tickets. You can use the _Filter tickets_ input field to filter the list of tickets.

If there are any current [cloud incidents](cloud-incidents.mdx), they will be displayed above the list of tickets, as shown in the screenshot above in yellow.

You can use the gear menu in the top right-hand corner of the page to [enable ticket sharing](ticket-sharing.mdx) or [manage the default email CC](manage-default-email-cc.mdx).

:::note

When you first visit the _Consulting and support_ page, your browser may prompt you to allow notifications. If you select _Allow_, the CMP will notify you whenever one of your tickets (or a ticket you are CCed on) is updated.

## Create a new request

:::tip

For simple questions and trivial requests, you can skip the ticket creation process (below) and, instead, send a message to your [shared Slack channel](shared-slack-channel.mdx) for a quick response from our engineering or support staff.

:::

Select the _NEW REQUEST_ button (shown in the previous screenshot) to create a new consulting or support request.

After selecting _NEW REQUEST_, the CMP will take you through the steps of creating a new request:

1. Select the _Cloud Platform_, _Product_, and _Resource_ so that we can route your ticket to the most appropriate engineer.

   :::note

   The CMP will display a list of any current [incidents](cloud-incidents.mdx) related to the cloud platform you select during this step.

   If one of the current incidents appears to be related to your request, you may still open a ticket with DoiT International. However, likely, we are already working with the cloud vendor to address the issue.

   :::

2. Select the severity of your request. Each severity level corresponds with a target response time:

   - General Guidance &mdash; Four hours
   - System Impaired &mdash; Two hours
   - Production System Impaired &mdash; One hour
   - Production System Down &mdash; 30 minutes

3. Write a descriptive subject, add any additional CCs to the ticket, and provide a complete description of your request.

   :::note

   In some cases, the CMP may automatically add your cloud vendor representative (e.g., account manager or customer engineer) to the list of _Additional CCs_. Please feel free to remove their email addresses if you do not wish to copy them on your ticket.

At any point, select the _BACK_ button to return to a previous step.

To complete your request, select the _SUBMIT_ button.
