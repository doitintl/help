# Consulting and support

DoiT International provides unlimited consulting and support for Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and our _Cloud Management Platform_ (CMP).

As a customer, you are not limited to any number of tickets or how much time DoiT International invests in supporting you as a client.

## View tickets

From within the CMP, select **Services** from the top navigation bar, then select **Consulting and support**:

/>

By default, the **Consulting and support** page lists all of your current request tickets. You can use the **Filter tickets** input field to filter the list of tickets.

Any current [cloud incidents](cloud-incidents.mdx) will be displayed above the list of tickets, as shown in the screenshot above in yellow.

You can use the gear menu in the top right-hand corner of the page to [enable ticket sharing](ticket-sharing.mdx) or [manage the default email CC](manage-default-email-cc.mdx).

:::note

When you first visit the **Consulting and support** page, your browser may prompt you to allow notifications. If you select **Allow**, the CMP will notify you whenever one of your tickets (or a ticket you are CCed on) is updated.

## Create a new request

:::tip

For simple questions and trivial requests, you can skip the ticket creation process (below) and send a message to your [shared Slack channel](shared-slack-channel.mdx) for a quick response from our engineering or support staff.

:::

If you wish to use the ticketing system, select the **New request** button (shown in the previous screenshot) to create a new consulting or support request.

After selecting **New request**, the CMP will take you through the steps of creating a new request:

1. Select the **Cloud Platform**, **Product**, and **Resource** so we can route your ticket to the most support specialist.

   :::important

   During this step, the CMP will display a filtered list of any current [cloud incidents](cloud-incidents.mdx) related to your selected cloud platform.

   If one of the current incidents appears to be related to your request, you may still open a ticket with DoiT International. However, likely, we are already working with the cloud vendor to address the issue.

   :::

2. Select the **Severity** of your request:

   <dl>
     <dt>
       <strong>General Guidance</strong>
     </dt>
     <dd>
       <p>You have general questions about a product.</p>
       <p>
         <em>We will respond within 12 business hours.</em>
       </p>
     </dd>
     <dt>
       <strong>System Impaired</strong>
     </dt>
     <dd>
       <p>An issue is impairing your systems.</p>
       <p>
         <em>We will respond within four business hours.</em>
       </p>
     </dd>
     <dt>
       <strong>Production System Impaired</strong>
     </dt>
     <dd>
       <p>An issue is impairing your production systems.</p>
       <p>
         <em>We will respond within four business hours.</em>
       </p>
     </dd>
     <dt>
       <strong>Production System Down</strong>
     </dt>
     <dd>
       <p>An issue is causing downtime to your production systems.</p>
       <p>
         <em>We will respond within 30 minutes, any day of the year.</em>
       </p>
     </dd>
   </dl>

   :::tip

   Please help us respond to you on time by selecting the correct **Severity** so that we can prioritize and route your request to the right support specialist.

3. Write a descriptive subject, add any additional CCs to the ticket, and provide a complete description of your request.

   :::tip

   The more details you provide, the quicker we resolve your request. If you omit the information we need, additional communication between you and your support specialist will delay ticket resolution.

   :::

   :::note

   In some cases, the CMP may automatically add your cloud vendor representative (e.g., account manager or customer engineer) to the list of **Additional CCs**. Please feel free to remove their email addresses if you do not wish to copy them on your ticket.

   :::

At any point, select the **Back** button to return to a previous step.

To complete your request, select the **Submit** button.
