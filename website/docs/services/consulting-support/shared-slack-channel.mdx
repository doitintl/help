# Shared Slack channel

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is great for synchronous communication (e.g., you have a quick question and want the answer _now_).

We encourage you to create a shared Slack channel with DoiT International so that you have 24/7 access to our industry-leading team of _Cloud Reliability Engineers_ (CREs), Cloud Architects, and Support Engineers.

You can use the shared Slack channel to ask questions or make requests:

- We will try to respond to you within fifteen minutes
- We will deal with simple questions and trivial requests on the spot
- If more investigation or work is needed, we will prompt you to [create a support request](index.mdx) so that we can switch to an asynchronous workflow

## Create your shared Slack channel

From within the CMP, select the gear icon from the top navigation bar, then choose _Slack_ (under _Account settings_) from the drop-down menu. After choosing the _Slack_ menu item, the CMP will bring you to the _Slack_ settings page:

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

<Image
  alt="A screenshot showing the _Slack_ settings page"
  img={require('../../assets/cmp-settings-slack-create.png')}
/>

From here, select _CREATE SHARED SLACK CHANNEL_ and follow the instructions.

If you haven't already added the DoiT International [Slack application](../../general/slack.mdx) to your Slack workspace, you can do so by selecting _ADD TO SLACK_ (bottom of the screen) and following the instructions.

Our Slack application can enhance your Slack experience by automatically unfurling links to the CMP and providing metadata and rich previews for [Cloud Analytics Reports](../../cloud-analytics/create-cloud-report/index.mdx) and [budgets](../../cloud-analytics/manage-budgets.mdx).

## Configure your shared Slack channel

Once your shared Slack channel has been created, you can configure the channel from the same _Slack_ settings page as before.

From within the CMP, select the gear icon from the top navigation bar, then choose _Slack_ (under _Account settings_) from the drop-down menu. After choosing the _Slack_ menu item, the CMP will bring you to the _Slack_ settings page:

<Image
  alt="A screenshot showing the _Slack_ settings page"
  img={require('../../assets/cmp-settings-slack-configure.png')}
/>

In the screenshot above, there is a shared channel named `#cmp-playground-com`.

Select the chain icon to the right of the channel name to copy a link you can share with other people to invite them to the channel.

Additionally, you can configure the CMP to send notifications to the shared Slack channel about:

- _Google Cloud or AWS Known Issues_ &mdash; Get notified about [cloud incidents](cloud-incidents.mdx)
- [_Cost Anomalies_](../../anomaly-detection/cloud-anomalies.mdx) &mdash; Get notified when our system detects abnormal usage of your cloud platform
- _Google Cloud and AWS Quotas Utilization Alerts_ &mdash; Get alerted when your cloud platform quota utilization exceeds 80%.
- _Daily Cost Digest_ &mdash; Get a [daily digest](../../general/profile.mdx#daily-digest-emails) with an optional filter for [cost attributions](../../cloud-analytics/attributing-cloud-spend.mdx)

The shared Slack channel configuration options will auto-save whenever you make a change.
