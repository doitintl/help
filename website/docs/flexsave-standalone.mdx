# Flexsave overview

Flexsave dynamically maximizes your cloud-compute discounts for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) and [Google Compute Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP) without any of the risks or limitations of long-term use commitments.

In most cases, save the equivalent of a 1-year commitment discount on your cloud-compute spend with on-demand access to DoiT International's wholesale inventory of AWS [Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/) (SPs), AWS [EC2 Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/) (RIs), and GCP [Committed Use Discounts](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds) (CUDs).
