# Spot Scaling overview

## What is Spot Scaling?

Spot Scaling proactively monitors your AWS [Auto-Scaling Groups (ASGs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html) and replaces all or some of an ASG's On-Demand EC2 instances with Spot Instances, using advanced algorithms analysis.

By managing your ASGs, Spot Scaling takes care of your launch templates, configuration, mixed instances policies, and a myriad of other configuration settings so you can focus on core activities.

## What are the benefits?

Instantly save up to 90% on your total compute spend by switching your ASG On-Demand Instances to Spot Instances, without any of the headaches of manual configuration:

_Reliable and safe_ &mdash; Works with AWS Native ASGs, follows [Spot Instance Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-leveraging-ec2-spot-instances/spot-best-practices.html), and supports fallback to on-demand.

_No cost overhead_ &mdash; We pass through 100% of all AWS Spot discounts.

_Quick and easy_ &mdash; Get started in less than 5 minutes with just a few clicks.

_No vendor lock-in_ &mdash; We only use the standard AWS products and services. Continue to use the AWS Management Console and APIs you way you always have done.

## How does it work?

### Analyze

Spot Scaling runs in the background, integrating natively with your AWS Auto Scaling Groups, and monitors the configuration and potential savings within each group.

### Recommend

Spot Scaling recommends the most suitable configuration for your Auto Scaling Group to run reliably and cost-effectively while simultaneously presenting the associated monthly potential savings vs. on-demand. You can accept your recommendations as-is or modify them as you see fit.

### Provision

After you apply the recommendations, Spot Scaling updates your Auto Scaling Group to work in a [mixed instances policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_MixedInstancesPolicy.html). In addition, Spot Scaling replaces On-Demand Instances with Spot Instances according to the recommended settings (which you can change anytime in the CMP).

When Spot Scaling cannot spin up Spot Instances due to lack of spot capacity, it can be configured to automatically fall back to On-Demand to ensure availability and revert to Spot Instances as soon as possible. As a result, the system uptime for your app(s) are maximized, while EC2 costs are minimized.

### Monitor

Spot Scaling continuously assesses your Auto Scaling Groups and presents important metrics such as:

- Costs
- Spot and On-Demand hours
- Savings for the previous and the current month
- Savings for all time

## Typical savings

**Scenario:** 50 m5.xlarge instances; replacing 80% of On-Demand Instances with Spot Instances
