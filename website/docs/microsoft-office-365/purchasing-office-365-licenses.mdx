# Purchasing Office 365 Licenses

If you manage your Office 365 licenses with DoiT International, you can easily purchase more. We increase your monthly payment to cover the new licenses.

:::note

Required Permission: **Licenses Manager**

You must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to purchase a license.

:::

Within the CMP, select _Billing_ from the top navigation bar and then select _Assets_. The CMP will take you to the _Assets_ page.

From the _Assets_ page, select _Office 365_ from the left-hand menu:

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

/>

You can see the number of licenses in use next to each _Quantity_ label.

When you have located the subscription you would like to modify, you can add or remove as many licenses as you like, using the **-1** and **+1** buttons, respectively.

To apply your changes, select the _APPLY_ button in the bottom right-hand corner of the card.

If you are purchasing additional licenses, you will be prompted to approve the purchase before continuing:

If you remove licenses, charges will be deducted from your account as reflected in the next month's billing to your organization.

:::note

Only FLEXIBLE plans allow you to decrease the number of licenses. For more information, please review the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/buy-licenses?view=o365-worldwide).
