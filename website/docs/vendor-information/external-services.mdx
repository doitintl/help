# External services we use

We rely on several third-party services which you may need to allow access to via your personal firewall. These are the mandatory services for Cloud Management Platform to function:

```text
https://*.googleapis.com/
https://accounts.google.com/
https://apis.google.com/
https://fonts.gstatic.com/
https://*.stripe.com/
https://*.stripe.network/
https://*.plaid.com/
```

These services are optional and they help us to make Cloud Management Platform better:

https://*.announcekit.app/
https://*.uservoice.com/
https://*.fullstory.com/
https://*.pingdom.net/
